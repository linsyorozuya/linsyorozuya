<p>As we mentioned in pricing strategy, DialyApod Pro offers a higher discount for early supporters, achieved by accessing the app‚Äôs purchase items.</p>

<p>This information, which includes subscribed or paid in-app purchases, etc., is anonymous and unrelated to the user‚Äôs identity, and DialyApod uses only the initial download date in it to determine if it is an early supporter.</p>

<p>iCloud Sync</p>

<p>DialyApod implements iCloud sync for most features, it uses the iCloud service provided by Apple. As you can imagine, this service is fairly secure and trusted by users around the world.</p>

<p>More importantly, there‚Äôs nothing to do with our service, no data will be sent to our server. In fact, we don‚Äôt even have a server for that.</p>

<p>Data Collected by DialyApod</p>

<p>In short, the DialyApod app itself does not collect any data from you. Yes, we don‚Äôt do any data tracking technology for ‚ÄúGrowth Hacking‚Äù purpose, we don‚Äôt even count how many users we have.
