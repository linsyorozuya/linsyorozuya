# DialyApod - Privacy Policy
Purchases

As we mentioned in pricing strategy, DialyApod Pro offers a higher discount for early supporters, achieved by accessing the app's purchase items.

This information, which includes subscribed or paid in-app purchases, etc., is anonymous and unrelated to the user's identity, and DialyApod uses only the initial download date in it to determine if it is an early supporter.

iCloud Sync

DialyApod implements iCloud sync for most features, it uses the iCloud service provided by Apple. As you can imagine, this service is fairly secure and trusted by users around the world.

More importantly, there's nothing to do with our service, no data will be sent to our server. In fact, we don't even have a server for that.

Data Collected by DialyApod

In short, the DialyApod app itself does not collect any data from you. Yes, we don't do any data tracking technology for "Growth Hacking" purpose, we don't even count how many users we have. We just want to provide a safe text processing environment, and do not care how "success" we are, or how the app is being used by users.
